I am a senior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics at Wellesley College. At Wellesley, I have been a grader, teaching assistant, and supplemental instructor for the computer science and math departments. Last summer, I was an intern at Amazon. The summer before that, I was a teaching assistant for Girls Who Code in Seattle where I worked with 20 high school girls in a 7-week summer immersion program. 

<br>
I am passionate about closing the gender gap in the tech field, software development, and picking up new languages and frameworks through working on projects. Besides programming, I enjoy traveling, eating, and playing sports (tennis, figure skating, squash).
