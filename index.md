I am currently a masters student in  MIT's Leaders for Global Operations (LGO) program pursuing a dual degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and MBA. Prior to graduate school, I was a software engineer at Wayfair for 4 years. I graduated from Wellesley College, where I received a BA in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics.
