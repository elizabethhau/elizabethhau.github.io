I currently a software engineer on the Transportation - Final Mile team at Wayfair. I graduated from Wellesley College, where I received a BA in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics. While at Wellesley, I was a grader, teaching assistant, and supplemental instructor for the computer science and math departments. I have been an intern at Amazon and a teaching assistant for Girls Who Code in Seattle where I worked with 20 high school girls in a 7-week summer immersion program.

<br>
I am passionate about closing the gender gap in the tech field, software development, and picking up new languages and frameworks through working on projects. Besides programming, I enjoy traveling, eating, and playing sports (tennis, figure skating, squash).
