I am a student in MIT's Leaders of Global Operations (LGO) program currently pursuing my masters degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and MBA. I enjoy traveling, eating, and playing sports (tennis, figure skating, squash). Prior to graduate school, I was a software engineer at Wayfair for 4 years and a graduate of Wellesley Colege.
